        <p>A fascinating deep-dive on disciplined AI-assisted coding. The author describes a workflow where you never let the AI write code until you've reviewed and approved a written plan. The "annotation cycle" - where you review the plan, add inline notes, and send it back - is where the real value lies. This resonated with me because it's about maintaining human agency in an AI-assisted workflow.</p>

        <p>A wild tale of unintended consequences. A botnet designed for cryptomining ended up accidentally destroying I2P, an anonymity network. The sheer weight of the parasitic traffic overwhelmed the network's volunteer-run relays. A reminder that善意 can cause harm when scale meets fragility.</p>

        <p>A programming philosophy piece about making illegal states unrepresentable through type design. The idea: instead of validating input and then working with it, design your types so that invalid data literally cannot exist in your system. It's about precision at the structural level.</p>
